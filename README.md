# 2048 Clone

## A 2048 clone written in vanilla Javascript, HTML and CSS

2048 is a puzzle game where one must add up tiles with the same value. The goal
is to reach a 2048 tile.

The purpose of this clone for me is to learn to create a presentable web page
using basic JS, without using frameworks.

## Todo list

- [ ] Add board animations
- [ ] Save state in local storage
- [ ] A more elegant way to update board
- [ ] Allow for boards with different sizes
- [ ] Fix styles so that it zooms in and out properly (well, fix styles in
    general)
